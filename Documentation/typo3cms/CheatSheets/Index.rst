TYPO3 CMS cheat sheets

This section holds files, which are related to the TYPO3 CMS Core
documentation, but which do not really fit into any specific manual.

This collection is permanent work in progress.

.. note::

   **Do you have a cheat sheet yourself?**

   Do you want **your** cheat sheets to be featured on docs.typo3.org as well?

   Then don't hesitate to `drop us a line <documentation@typo3.org>`__!

   Every contribution is welcome!
